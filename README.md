> Office hours with Sasha (`@sasha` on Slack):<br>
Tuesdays & Thursdays from 5:00-6:00, located at the common table to the left of the front desk.

How To Use This Repo
--------------------

This is the repository where you'll submit your homework.    
Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/code``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```JS-SF-9-homework``` folder using your real name and github account name. Example: ```JS-SF-9-homework/Sasha-svodnik```. That will make it easier for us to remember everyone's github name. :)
4. For each homework make sure to copy over the `Homework-x` directory to your named directory. Example for homework #2: `JS-SF-9-homework/Sasha-svodnik/Homework-2/hubot.js`

Example of how your local homework directory should be structured:


    |-- code/
        |-- JS-SF-9-resources/ (cloned from Github)
        |-- JS-SF-9-homework/ (cloned from Github)
            |-- firstName-githubUsername/
                |-- Homework-1/
                    |- bottlesOfBeer.js
                    |- randAddressGenerator.js
                |-- Homework-2/
                    |- hubot.js
                |-- Homework-3/
                |-- Homework-4/
                |-- Homework-5/



Weekly Homework
